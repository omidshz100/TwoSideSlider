# Custom Row View in SwiftUI

## Overview

This SwiftUI component, `Row`, represents a custom row view that can be used in SwiftUI-based applications. The row is designed for flexibility and customization, allowing developers to easily integrate it into their projects.

## Features

- Provides a clean and modern design

## Usage

### Initialization

To use the `Row` component, initialize it with the necessary parameters.

```swift
let row = Row(title: "Your Title", description: "Your Description")
```

### Integration

Integrate the `Row` into your SwiftUI views by simply adding it as a subview.

```swift
struct YourView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Row(title: "Your Title", description: "Your Description")
            .padding()
    }
}
```

### Customization

The appearance of the row can be customized by adjusting properties such as font, color, or any other styling within the `Row` struct.

```swift
Row(title: "Your Title", description: "Your Description")
    .foregroundColor(.blue)
    .font(.headline)
```

## Implementation Details

The `Row` struct comprises a title and a description, making it versatile for various use cases. The design is intentionally kept simple for easy integration into different UI scenarios.

### Example

Here's a quick example of how you can use this custom row:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Row(title: "Item 1", description: "Description for Item 1")
            Row(title: "Item 2", description: "Description for Item 2")
            // Add more rows as needed
        }
    }
}
```
